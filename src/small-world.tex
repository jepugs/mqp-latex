\section{Elementary Graph Theory}

We begin by recalling some conventional definitions and notations from graph
theory.

\begin{definition}
  A \textbf{graph} $G$ is a pair of sets $(V,E)$ such that $E = V \times V$,
  where equality on $E$ disregards order, that is $(u,v) = (v,u)$. We call $V$
  the \textbf{vertices} of $G$ and $E$ the \textbf{edges} of $G$.
\end{definition}

For our purpose, $V$ will always be a sequence of natural numbers starting from
$1$, that is

\[
  V = \{ n \in \mathbb{N} : 1 \leq i \leq N \}
\]

for some $N$.

\begin{remark}[Notation]
  Let $G$ be a graph.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item We access the vertices and edges of G by the functions $V(G)$ and $E(G)$
    respectively.
  \item $v \in G$ is an equivalent statement to $v \in V(G)$
  \item $|G|$, called the \textbf{order} of $G$, is equal to $|V(G)|$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{remark}

\section{Small-World and Scale-free Networks}

The motivation for DSD comes from small-world networks, which are a class of
graphs characterized by having a very small average shortest-path distance
between any two vertices compared to the overall size of the graph.


\begin{definition}
  The \textbf{characteristic path length} of a graph $G = (V,E)$ is the average
  distance between vertices in the graph, which is given by

  \[ L_G = \frac{1}{|E|} \sum_{\substack{u,v \in V \\ u \neq v}} \dist(u,v)\]

  where $\dist(u,v)$ is shortest-path distance. 
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  Consider a graph $G = (V,E)$. $G$ is a \textbf{small-world network} if
  $L_G \sim \log{|V|}$.
\end{definition}

These graphs are ubiquitous in a variety of application areas and commonly have
other characteristics that aren't necessarily captured in the definition. One
common additional property is that small-world networks often contain hubs,
which are vertices with very degree much higher than the average in the graphs.
This property is most often examined by looking at the distribution of vertex
degrees in the graph.

% We can partially describe this structure in terms of the
% clustering coefficient.

% \begin{definition}
%   Let $v$ be a vertex in a graph $G = (V,E)$.

%   Consider the subgraph formed by the neighborhood of $v$. This subgraph has at
%   most $\deg(v)(\deg(v) - 1)$ edges, which happens when it is a clique. Denote
%   the number of edges of the neighborhood subgraph by $E_{N(v)}$.

%   The \textbf{clustering coefficient} $C_v$ is defined by
%   $C_v = \frac{E_{N(v)}}{\deg(v)(\deg(v) - 1)}$, that is, $C_v$ is the
%   proportion of edges in the neighborhood subgraph out of all possible edges.
%   The clustering coefficient of $G$ is the average of all vertex clustering
%   coefficients, $C_G = \frac{\sum_{v \in V}{C_v}}{|V|}$.
% \end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  A \textbf{scale-free network} is a graph whose vertex degrees follow a power
  law distribution.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[R. Cohen and S. Havlin]
  Scale-free networks are small-world networks.
\end{theorem}

Real world examples of scale-free networks are abundant and include the world
wide web, cellular communication networks, and protein-protein interaction (PPI)
networks. It is not surprising, then, that scale-free networks are necessarily
small-worlds networks, however we defer to ~\cite{PhysRevLett.90.058701} for
proof of this.


\section{Random Graphs}

\begin{definition}
  A \textbf{random graph} is a random variable for which all outcomes are
  undirected graphs.

  A \textbf{random graph process}, denoted $(G_t)$, is a family of random graphs
  indexed by a discrete time $t \in \mathbb{N}$.
\end{definition}

We are interested in random graph processes which build small-worlds networks.
The Watts-Strogatz graphs are the earliest example of such a process. They are
defined by starting with a regular ring lattice and randomly rewiring edges
until the graph is obtained.

\begin{definition}
  An $n$-$k$ \textbf{regular ring lattice} is a graph $(V, E)$ with $n$ vertices
  such that $u,v$ is an edge if and only if $|u-v| \leq \frac{k}{2}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  Let $v$ be a vertex in a graph. We can \textbf{rewire} $v$ by deleting one
  edge of $v$ and replacing it with 
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  Given a probability $p$ and regular ring lattice parameters $n$ and $k$, we
  define the $(n,k,p)$ \textbf{Watts-Strogatz Process} as follows.

  Let $r(G,v)$ be a random process that rewires vertex $v$ in a graph $G$. We
  define a family of graphs, $(G_t)$, by

  \[
    G_{t+1} = \left\{
      \begin{array}{lc}
        r(G_t,t) &: X \leq p \\
        G_t &: X > p
      \end{array}
    \right.
  \]

  for $t = 1,\dots, |G|$, where $G_0$ is the $n$-$k$ regular ring lattice, and
  $X$ is a uniform random variable in the range $[0,1]$. That is, we iterate
  over the vertices of the ring lattice and rewire each one with probability
  $p$.

  We call graphs sampled from $G_{|G|}$ \textbf{Watts-Strogatz graphs}.
\end{definition}

The Watts-Strogatz graphs are small-world networks for all but extremely small
values of $p$. However, in general, they are not scale free networks, and thus
do not capture the structural characteristics of many practical data sets.

\begin{definition}
  Let any graph $G_0$ be given as well as some parameter $m$, $m \leq |G_0|$. We
  build the random graph $G_{t+1}$ by adding a new vertex to $G_t$ and
  connecting it to $m$ vertices of $G_t$ with probabilities proportional to the
  degree of each vertex. That is, the probability of adding an edge to a vertex
  $u$ is

  \[
    p_u = \frac{\deg(v)}{\sum_{v \in G_t} \deg(v)}
  \]

  on the first step, and this is done a total of m times without replacement.

  We call $(G_t)$ the $(G_o,m)$-\textbf{Barab\'asi-Albert process} and graphs sampled
  from $G_n$ $(G_o,m,n)$-\textbf{Barab\'asi-Albert graphs}.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[A. Barab\'asi and R. Albert]
  \textbf{Barab\'asi-Albert graphs} are scale-free
\end{theorem}
