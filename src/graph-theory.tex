We begin by recalling some conventional definitions and notations from graph
theory.

\begin{definition}
  A \textbf{graph} $G$ is a pair of sets $(V,E)$ such that $E = V \times V$,
  where equality on $E$ disregards order, that is $(u,v) = (v,u)$. We call $V$
  the set of \textbf{vertices} of $G$ and $E$ the set of \textbf{edges} of $G$.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}[The Pentagon]
  The \textbf{pentagon}, also known as the \textbf{5-cycle}, is the graph
  $(V,E)$ defined by $V = \{0,1,2,3,4\}$ and $E = \{(0,1),(1,2),(2,3),(4,0)\}$.

\end{example}

\begin{remark}[Notation]
  Let $G$ be a graph.

  % reword access, ensure that these accessors are useful
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Let $G = (V,E)$ be a graph. For convenience, we will use subscript
    notation to refer to the edge and vertex sets of $G$, i.e. $V_G = V$ and
    $E_G = E$.
  \item $v \in G$ is an equivalent statement to $v \in V_G$
  \item $|G|$, called the \textbf{order} of $G$, is equal to $|V_G|$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{remark}

When we speak about graphs, we are concerned with the structure of the graph
rather than the specific symbols in its vertex set. Thus we use the following
definition of equality.

\begin{definition}[Equivalence of graphs]
  Two graphs $G_1$ and $G_2$ are equal if there exists a bijection $\phi :
  V_{G_1} \to V_{G_2}$ such that $(u,v) \in V_{G_1} \Leftrightarrow
  (\phi(u),\phi(v)) \in V_{G_2}$.
\end{definition}

For convenience, when we talk about ``a graph'' in the future, we will generally
be referring to the class of all equivalent classes, as in the next example.

\begin{example}
  The \textbf{empty graph} of order $n$ is the graph such that $|V| = n$ and $E
  = \varnothing$.

  The \textbf{complete graph} or order $n$, denoted $K_n$, is the graph
  containing every possible edge, so that $|E_{K_n}| = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}$.
\end{example}

\begin{definition}
  The \textbf{degree} of a vertex $u \in G$, denoted $\deg (u)$, is the number
  of edges in $G$ which contain $u$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  A \textbf{walk} of a graph $G$ is an alternating sequence of edges and
  vertices such that each vertex is coincident to the edges before and after it.

  A \textbf{path} is the sequence of edges in a walk where every vertex is
  unique.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  The \textbf{adjacency matrix} $A$ of a graph $G$ is given by
  \[
    A_{ij} = \begin{cases}
      1 &: (i,j) ~\text{is an edge in $G$} \\
      0 &: \text{otherwise} \\
    \end{cases}
  \]
\end{definition}

%% Adjacency matrix properties
% - symmetric, (eigenvalues are real)
% - eigenvectors
% - spectral gap (+ defn)
% - example: k-regular graphs have largest (simple?) eigenvalue

Note that the adjacency matrix of a graph is not unique in general. Depending on
the way that the vertices of $G$ are numbered, we may end up with a different
matrix. However, for every adjacency matrix the following holds:


\begin{remark}
  Let $A$ be the adjacency matrix of a graph $G$. Then the following is true:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $A$ is symmetric (so the eigenvalues of $A$ are real)
  \item $A$ corresponds to a graph that is unique up to equivalence
  \item $A$ is irreducible if and only if $G$ is connected
  \item $A$ has a simple positive real eigenvalue $r$ of maximum magnitude
  \item $r$ has corresponding eigenvector with all positive components
  \end{enumerate}
\end{remark}

\begin{proof}
  (1) follows trivially from the definition of $A$ (recall that because edges in
  are undirected, $(u,v) \in E_G \Leftrightarrow (v,u) \in E_G$).

  (2) self-evident
\end{proof}

To prove the remaining properties, we require some additional results from
linear algebra. First, recall this equivalent definition of reducibility:

\begin{definition}
  A matrix is reducible if and only if it can be put in block upper triangular
  form by simultaneous row and column permutations. In other words, a matrix $M$
  is irreducible if and only if there exists a permutation matrix $P$ such that
  $P^{-1}MP$ is block upper triangular.
\end{definition}

\begin{proof}
  We can now show (3). First, we observe that $P^{-1}AP$ is an adjacency matrix
  of a graph equivalent to $G$ for any permutation matrix $P$. So WLOG, suppose
  that $G$ is connected and $A$ is already in block upper triangular form. Then
  because $A$ is symmetric, we have

  \[
    A = \begin{bmatrix}
      B & \mathbf{0} \\
      \mathbf{0} & C
    \end{bmatrix}
  \]

  where $B$, $C$, are square block matrices. Say that $B$ has size $m \times m$.
  It is clear that there are no edges connecting the vertices in $\{1, ..., m\}$
  to those in $\{m+1, ..., n\}$. Thus $G$ is not be connected, which is a
  contradiction.
\end{proof}

The irreducibility result allows us to apply the following theorem, resulting
immediately in the remaining properties of $A$.

\begin{theorem}[Perron-Frobenius for Nonnegative Matrices]
  Let $A$ be an irreducible nonnegative square matrix of order $n$ and period
  $h$. The following is true.

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Let $r$ be the maximum magnitude of the eigenvalues of $A$. $r$ is a
    (real,positive) simple eigenvalue of $A$.
  \item $r$ has left and right eigenvectors whose components are all positive
  \item The only eigenvectors of $A$ whose components are all positive have
    eigenvalue $r$.
  \item
    \[ \min_i \sum_j a_{ij} \leq r \leq \max_i \sum_j a_{ij} \].
  \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}


Which shows (4) and (5). Indeed, The irreducibility and nonnegativity of $A$
yields many other interesting properties which we omit here.

We will next explore graph Laplacians, whose spectra are closely related to
those of adjacency matrices.

\begin{definition}
  The \textbf{degree matrix} of $G$ is the diagonal matrix defined by
  \[
    D_{ij} = \begin{cases}
      \deg(i) &: i = j \\
      0 &: i \neq j
    \end{cases}
  \]
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  The \textbf{graph laplacian} of $G$ is given by $L = D - A$, where $D$ is the
  degree matrix of $G$ and $A$ is the adjacency matrix. In other words,

  \[
    L_{ij} = \begin{cases}
      \deg(i) &: i=j \\
      -1 &: (i,j) ~\text{is an edge in $G$} \\
      0 &: \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
  \]
\end{definition}

\section{Small-World and Scale-free Networks}

The motivation for DSD comes from small-world networks, which are a class of
graphs characterized by having a very small average shortest-path distance
between any two vertices compared to the overall size of the graph.

% eigenvalues and eigenvectors

\begin{definition}
  The \textbf{characteristic path length} of a graph $G = (V,E)$ is the average
  distance between vertices in the graph, which is given by

  \[ L_G = \frac{1}{|E|} \sum_{\substack{u,v \in V \\ u \neq v}} \dist(u,v)\]

  where $\dist(u,v)$ is shortest-path distance. 
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  Consider a graph $G = (V,E)$. $G$ is a \textbf{small-world network} if
  $L_G \sim \log{|V|}$.
\end{definition}

Small-world networks are ubiquitous in a variety of applications areas. However,
many real-world examples of such graphs also have other distinctive structural
properties which are not necessarily captured by their small-worldedness alone.
[citation needed]

% We can partially describe this structure in terms of the
% clustering coefficient.

% \begin{definition}
%   Let $v$ be a vertex in a graph $G = (V,E)$.

%   Consider the subgraph formed by the neighborhood of $v$. This subgraph has at
%   most $\deg(v)(\deg(v) - 1)$ edges, which happens when it is a clique. Denote
%   the number of edges of the neighborhood subgraph by $E_{N(v)}$.

%   The \textbf{clustering coefficient} $C_v$ is defined by
%   $C_v = \frac{E_{N(v)}}{\deg(v)(\deg(v) - 1)}$, that is, $C_v$ is the
%   proportion of edges in the neighborhood subgraph out of all possible edges.
%   The clustering coefficient of $G$ is the average of all vertex clustering
%   coefficients, $C_G = \frac{\sum_{v \in V}{C_v}}{|V|}$.
% \end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  A \textbf{scale-free network} is a graph whose vertex degrees follow a power
  law. That is, given a randomly selected $u \in G$, $P(\deg(u) = k) \sim
  k^{-\gamma}$ for some $\gamma > 0$.
\end{definition}

One of the defining characteristics of power law distributions is that they have
very long tails. In a scale-free graph with many vertices, this implies the
existence of \textbf{hubs}, which we informally define as vertices whose degrees
are far larger than average in the graph.

\begin{theorem}[R. Cohen and S. Havlin]
  Scale-free networks are small-world networks.
\end{theorem}

Real world examples of scale-free networks are abundant and include the world
wide web, cellular communication networks, and protein-protein interaction (PPI)
networks. It is not surprising, then, that scale-free networks are necessarily
small-worlds networks, however we defer to Cohen and Havlin for proof of this
fact ~\cite{PhysRevLett.90.058701}.


\section{Random Graphs}

% exponential distribution eigenvalues

\begin{definition}
  A \textbf{random graph} is a random variable for which all outcomes are
  undirected graphs.

  A \textbf{random graph process}, denoted $(G_t)$, is a family of random graphs
  indexed by a discrete time $t \in \mathbb{N}$.
\end{definition}

We are interested in random graph processes which build small-worlds networks.
The Watts-Strogatz graphs are the earliest example of such a process. They are
defined by starting with a regular ring lattice and randomly rewiring edges
until the graph is obtained.

\begin{definition}
  An $n$-$k$ \textbf{regular ring lattice} is a graph $(V, E)$ with $n$ vertices
  such that $u,v$ is an edge if and only if $|u-v| \leq \frac{k}{2}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  Let $v$ be a vertex in a graph. We can \textbf{rewire} $v$ by deleting one
  edge of $v$ and replacing it with 
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  Given a probability $p$ and regular ring lattice parameters $n$ and $k$, we
  define the $(n,k,p)$ \textbf{Watts-Strogatz Process} as follows.

  Let $r(G,v)$ be a random process that rewires vertex $v$ in a graph $G$. We
  define a family of graphs, $(G_t)$, by

  \[
    G_{t+1} = \left\{
      \begin{array}{lc}
        r(G_t,t) &: X \leq p \\
        G_t &: X > p
      \end{array}
    \right.
  \]

  for $t = 1,\dots, |G|$, where $G_0$ is the $n$-$k$ regular ring lattice, and
  $X$ is a uniform random variable in the range $[0,1]$. That is, we iterate
  over the vertices of the ring lattice and rewire each one with probability
  $p$.

  We call graphs sampled from $G_{|G|}$ \textbf{Watts-Strogatz graphs}.
\end{definition}

The Watts-Strogatz graphs are small-world networks for all but extremely small
values of $p$ ~\cite{Watts1998Collective}. However, in general, they are not
scale free networks ~\cite{Barabasi509}, and thus do not show the structural
characteristics of many practical data sets.

\begin{definition}
  Let any graph $G_0$ be given as well as some parameter $m$, $m \leq |G_0|$. We
  build the random graph $G_{t+1}$ by adding a new vertex to $G_t$ and
  connecting it to $m$ vertices of $G_t$ with probabilities proportional to the
  degree of each vertex. That is, the probability of adding an edge to a vertex
  $u$ is

  \[
    p_u = \frac{\deg(v)}{\sum_{v \in G_t} \deg(v)}
  \]

  on the first step, and this is done a total of m times without replacement.

  We call $(G_t)$ the $(G_o,m)$-\textbf{Barab\'asi-Albert (BA) process} and graphs
  sampled from $G_n$ $(G_o,m,n)$-\textbf{Barab\'asi-Albert (BA) graphs}.
\end{definition}

This type of model, where edges to a new vertex are drawn with non-uniform
probability, is known as \textbf{preferential attachment}.

\begin{theorem}[A. Barab\'asi and R. Albert]
  \textbf{Barab\'asi-Albert graphs} are scale-free
\end{theorem}
